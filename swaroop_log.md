2. As a member of the architectural team for the first three halfdays of the upcoming sprint
I will be working on the story which is based on identifying the gaps in Implementation, Scenario when designer(user) provides a set of four unordered locations for the quest in deployment.
So regarding this isuue i am going to conduct a meeting with the design data team and I will design certain testcases for the adding locations activity, 
So i can identify the gaps present in that deployment. And coming to next three half days i have been assigned to a user story which is based on identifying the gaps in Implementation, 
Scenario For each location, the designer provides location coordinates (Lat, Long, default radius) ", So i am going to discuss with the design data team and i am going to review the RFP again
and will adress the issue raised.

- HalfDay-1
- I have attended my class through Zoom and we had a meeting after the class session about the reviews given by the client regarding technology stack. I have been assigned to search for the benfits of Node.js and also about nest.js framework. I have gone through our RFP and again validated whether the backend node technology will reach our requorements or not. After some few discussions we have finally decided to use node as our back end technology.

- HalfDay-2
- I have attended my class through Zoom and started working on my user story which is select the deployment tool, I have gone through all the compatibility reasearch between node and Heroku platform, So Heroku is a cloud service provider and software development platform which facilitates fast and effective deploying and scaling of web applications. It has 140 inbuilt add-ons, ranging from alerts, analytic tools security services which are used for purpose like monitoring, caching and mailing or networking add-ons. And also 
i have gone through some projects which are using node and heroku as their backend and deployment and checked their performace like node uses single threaded technique for requests and responses, it uses asynchronus way to transmits the requests and responses this proves that it can handle multiple tasks at a time. So after all discussion with the
team we have decided heroku as our deployment tool.

- HalfDay-3
- I have attended the help Session conducted by my GA prasad and clarified some doubts regarding sprint planning and also had a discussion with the sprint planning team
regarding user stories. I have also started working on the story which is assigned to me which is identifying the gaps between implementation for the given scenario.
