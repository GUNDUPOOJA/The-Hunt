# The-Hunt
“The Hunt game” is an outdoor collaborative game which allows the authorized users to play with other team members or to compete with other players in finding the hidden locations in a quest. We are designing this game in view that this is compatible with iPhone SE, Laptop, Tablet, and Android phones. 

A first time user has to register in order to become a player in the game with the Open Authorization. After the user creates an account he can login into the account. The player will have options either to join a team or to create a team. In order to join a team an invitation will be sent to the users via mail. The invitation will be automatic rejection if the user does not respond to it within three days.
A user can create a quest containing number of locations that can be identified by means of latitudes and longitudes. A team containing players will compete to find the locations within specified time period. The team which identifies maximum number of locations within quest gains maximum number of points and will be the winner.
